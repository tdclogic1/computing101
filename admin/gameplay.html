            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The objective of the game is to solve the mystery by correctly identifying the suspect, weapon, and location of the crime.</p>

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player creates an account and logs into the game platform.</li>
                <li>Players join a game room and choose a character avatar.</li>
                <li>The system randomly selects a suspect, weapon, and location. These are hidden from the players.</li>
                <li>The remaining cards are distributed digitally to the players.</li>
                <li>Each player receives a digital detective notebook to keep track of their clues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Players take turns moving their avatars and making suggestions about the crime.</li>
                <li>A suggestion must include a suspect, weapon, and location.</li>
                <li>If the suggestion matches the cards in another player's digital hand, that player must show one of the matching cards to the player who made the suggestion.</li>
                <li>If the suggestion does not match any cards in another player's hand, it is noted as a potential solution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Accusation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When a player feels confident, they can make an accusation, naming the suspect, weapon, and location.</li>
                <li>If the accusation is correct, the player wins the game.</li>
                <li>If the accusation is incorrect, the player is eliminated from making further suggestions or accusations, but must continue showing cards if asked.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
            <p>The game is won when a player correctly identifies the suspect, weapon, and location of the crime.</p>
