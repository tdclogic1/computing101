            <h2>Step 1: Introduction to the Mystery</h2>
            <p><strong>Setting</strong>: The coastal town of Ashford, known for its charming, quiet nature, is suddenly thrown into turmoil.</p>
            <p><strong>Discovery of the Body</strong>: The body of local historian Charles Abernathy is found in the lighthouse, locked from the inside. There are no signs of a struggle, but there is a faint smell of perfume and a bloodstained letter in his pocket.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 2: Introduction of the Detective</h2>
            <p><strong>Detective Eliza Monroe</strong>: A sharp, intuitive investigator is called to Ashford to solve the case. She’s just returned after a long break from her career and is forced back into action with this perplexing murder.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 3: Initial Clues</h2>
            <p><strong>The Letter</strong>: A mysterious, unsigned letter found in Charles’s pocket reads:</p>
            <blockquote>“The truth lies in the shadows. The past will come to light when the moon rises high. You should have stayed away, but now you’ll pay the price for your curiosity.”</blockquote>
            <p><strong>The Perfume</strong>: The rare perfume found in the lighthouse is traced to a boutique owned by Eleanor Hargrave, a childhood friend of Charles. The perfume raises suspicion, as it is rare and expensive.</p>
            <p><strong>The Map</strong>: Charles had recently discovered an old map that might lead to a hidden cavern beneath the lighthouse, fueling his obsession with the town’s history.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 4: Interviewing Key Suspects</h2>
            <p><strong>Eleanor Hargrave</strong>: The boutique owner and Charles’s former friend. She claims she wasn’t near the lighthouse, but her alibi doesn’t hold up. She avoids discussing the perfume when questioned.</p>
            <p><strong>Maxwell Grant</strong>: A young historian who worked with Charles. He acts strangely when questioned about the map and the cavern, suggesting he may know more than he’s letting on.</p>
            <p><strong>Clara Abernathy</strong>: Charles’s estranged sister. She seems oddly unaffected by her brother’s death, offering no emotional response. She’s returned to Ashford after being absent for years and lives in the family’s old, rumored-to-be-cursed house.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 5: The Uncovering of Secrets</h2>
            <p><strong>The Hidden Cavern</strong>: Eliza learns that the cavern beneath the lighthouse holds not only ancient relics but also a hidden treasure, one that Charles had recently uncovered. This treasure is linked to the town’s founding, and Charles was on the verge of revealing its location, which would destroy the carefully crafted history of Ashford.</p>
            <p><strong>Possible Motive</strong>: The realization that the treasure could be at the center of the murder reveals a strong motive for the crime. Someone didn't want Charles to reveal its location.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 6: The Killer’s Motive</h2>
            <p><strong>Clara’s Greed</strong>: Eliza deduces that Clara had been hiding the treasure for years, and in a bid to protect it—and the family’s wealth—she killed her brother to prevent him from exposing the truth.</p>
            <p><strong>The Perfume and Letter</strong>: Clara had orchestrated the clues to frame Eleanor. The letter was a red herring, and the perfume was planted to mislead the investigation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 7: The Final Confrontation</h2>
            <p><strong>Clara’s Confession</strong>: In a tense confrontation at the lighthouse, Eliza confronts Clara, who admits to the murder. Clara had been desperate to keep the treasure hidden, fearing its discovery would ruin the town’s reputation and her family’s legacy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 8: The Aftermath</h2>
            <p><strong>Clara’s Arrest</strong>: Clara is arrested for the murder of her brother, and Ashford begins to heal from the tragedy.</p>
            <p><strong>The Mystery of the Treasure</strong>: While the murderer is caught, the secret of the hidden treasure remains unresolved. Will anyone ever discover its true location? The mystery is left open-ended.</p>
